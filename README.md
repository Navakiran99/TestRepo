# TestRepo
#Testrepo for deployment testing
#This is a Public GIThub Repo where we commit the file updates for deploying the html page to the web server document directory
#Automated repeatable deplotment will be taken care by the Auto trigerred pipeline where the any changes committed to this Repository and Web hooking has been set with Jenkins which triggers the git checkout and deploys the file to the server
#Jenkins is configured on the Bastion server and git is installed on the Bastion Server
#Bastion server is the only server that has the ability to connect with both web server and the app server
